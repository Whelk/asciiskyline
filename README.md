# asciiskyline
ASCII Skyline - Another recreation of an old screensaver from our home computer when I was a kid, but this time in curses/ASCII.  It produces a simple starry city skyline in your terminal, with the stars winking in and out and the lights in the office windows of the buildings below going on and off as their occupants go about whatever business they're up to.

Inspired by the Starry Skyline module of the After Dark screensavers of old.  See https://github.com/Whelk/nossky/ for the version I made with pygame a while back to try something graphical.  Pygame may not have been the best choice.  It seemed pretty CPU intensive for something so simple, especially when turned up to higher speeds, so here we are with this alternate curses/terminal version.
